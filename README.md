## Types of Data-Structure
1. Linear
2. Non-Linear

## Linear
1. Array
2. Stack
3. Queues (Simple, Circular, Double Ended, Priority)
4. Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
## Non-Linear
1. Trees
2. Graphs
3. Tables
4. Sets

## Arrays

### What is an Array❓❓
-  An array is a collection of items of the same variable type that are stored at contiguous memory locations.
-  Each item in an array is indexed starting with 0 . Each element in an array is accessed through its index.
### Need of Array Data Structures 🤔
-  Storing data for processing
-  Representing data in tables and matrices
-  Creating dynamic data structures such as linked lists and trees
-  Implementing data structures such as stacks and queues
### Types of Array 🎞
-  There are two main types of arrays:
-  One-dimensional arrays: These arrays store a single row of elements.
-  Multidimensional arrays: These arrays store multiple rows of elements.
### Array Operations 🖇
- 1 Traversal : Visiting each element of an array in a specific order (e.g., sequential, reverse).
-   [Traversal](./Arrays/traversal.c)
- 2 Insertion : Adding a new element to an array at a specific index.
-   [Insertion at the beginning](./Arrays/insert_start.c)
-   [Insertion at the end](Arrays/insert_end.c)
-   [Insertion at the specified position (Unsorted)](Arrays/insert_end.c)
-   Insertion at the specified position (Sorted)
- 3 Deletion : Removing an element from an array at a specific index.
-   [Deletion from the beginning](Arrays/delete_start.c)
-   [Deletion from the end](Arrays/delete_end.c)
-   [Deletion at the specified position (Unsorted)](Arrays/delete_pos.c)
-   Deletion at the specified position (Sorted)
- 4 Searching : Finding the index of an element in an array.
### Applications of Array 🚀
- Storing data for processing
- Implementing data structures such as stacks and queues
- Representing data in tables and matrices
- Creating dynamic data structures such as linked lists and trees
